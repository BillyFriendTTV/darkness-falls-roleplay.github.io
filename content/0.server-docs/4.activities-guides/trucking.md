# Courier Deliveries

![Mules](https://i.imgur.com/FEksjif.png)

Courier jobs are your entry level types of deliveries and are faster on the road and usually have more stops in between in return are quicker to complete and less profitable than Trailer deliveries. These jobs are typically done in vehicles such as mules and are much easier to drive and reverse.


## How to:

1. Now that you have accepted your mission you will receive a GPS location to pick up the cargo for your deliveries. Reverse your truck to the loading bay and pick up the load. You will have to be straight otherwise the workers won’t load your truck.

2. Once you’ve secured your cargo you will have multiple stops available to deliver in whatever order you please. Upon arriving at the stop, reverse to the loading bay and ensure you park straight onto the loading bay. Repeat until you’ve finished all your stops.

3. Upon completing all your stops you will be notified that your mission is complete. Click `Continue` to receive your payment and xp then start your next mission!

# Trailer Deliveries

Trailer Jobs are unlocked at level 50 and require a larger truck such as a phantom that can hitch semi trailers. These jobs are much more rewarding however take longer and require more skill to reverse. Comb your mullet and get a southern cross tattoo because you’re in the big leagues now boy. 


## How to:

1. Now that you’re buckled up in your Phantom can accept Trailer missions on the Jobs Tablet by pressing `F7`. You will receive a GPS location to pick up a trailer for your deliveries. Reverse your truck to the trailer to hitch the trailer to your vehicle. 

2. Once you’ve hitched your trailer, you will have a stop or stops available to deliver in whatever order you please. Upon arriving at the stop, reverse the trailer into the loading bay and ensure your trailer is parked straight onto the loading bay. Be careful not to ‘jackknife’ your trailer and unlatch it. Repeat until you’ve finished all your stops.

3. At your final destination you will be asked to unhitch the trailer. This can be done by holding down your H key.

4. Now that you’ve completed all your stops you will be notified that your mission is complete. Click continue to receive your payment and xp then start your next mission!

## Illegal Transports

Illegal Transports add an exciting factor of risk for reward. These missions are found on the jobs tablet and are distinguishable by a **Black and Red** button. These missions can be done in both Courier and Trailer Vehicles. Make sure you steer clear of the feds because your truck will be flagged and tracked. Don’t get pulled over!
