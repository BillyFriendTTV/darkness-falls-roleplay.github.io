# How to Connect

::alert{type="info"}
Need to install FiveM? See [Installation](/server-docs/getting-started/installation).
::

Now that you have [FiveM installed](/server-docs/getting-started/installation), let's get you verified and connected to FDG for the first time!

## Discord Verification

::alert{type="warning"}
You **must** verify your Discord account **before** connecting to the server, otherwise you won't be able to join the server. Already verified? [Skip this section](#connect-to-the-server).
::

1. If you haven't already, join the **[FDG Discord](https://discord.gg/fatduckgaming)** server.
2. Go to the `#fivem-verify` text channel.
3. Type `!verify`.
4. If successful, you'll see `You have successfully verified!` :icon{name="noto:check-mark-button"} in chat.

## Connect to the Server

Once [verified in Discord](#discord-verification), you can now connect to the server! There are three ways to connect:
- By connect URL (easiest)
- By console command
- By FiveM server browser

### By Connect URL

1. In your browser, navigate to https://rp.fatduckgaming.com.
2. Your browser will ask if you want to open FiveM. Select `Open FiveM`. In Chrome, it should look like this: ![Connect URL open example](https://imgur.com/a/Pfm72mV)
3. FiveM will launch and automatically start connecting to FDG. ![FDG connecting dialog](https://imgur.com/a/X0Zc7kP)

### By Console Command

1. Open FiveM.
2. Open the FiveM console using the `F8` key.
3. In the console, run `connect 3y3jjr`.

### By FiveM Server Browser

1. Open the [FiveM Server Browser](https://servers.fivem.net/) (you can also access this browser in the FiveM executable).
2. Serach for `Fat Duck Gaming`.
3. Select FDG from the results (select the server with more players on it, sometimes our test servers appear in the results). ![FiveM Server browser example](https://imgur.com/a/z5DqvmT)
4. Click the `CONNECT` button. ![FiveM Server browser server example](https://imgur.com/a/CfKYSQw)
5. If your using the [FiveM Server Browser](https://servers.fivem.net/) in Chrome, you might need to confirm with `Open FiveM`. ![Chrome permissions example](https://imgur.com/a/7PVgMwa)
