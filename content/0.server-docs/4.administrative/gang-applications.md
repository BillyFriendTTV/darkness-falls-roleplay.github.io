# Gang Application Guidelines

Are you seeking to elevate your criminal prowess to new heights? Whether you've already honed your skills in the underworld or aspire to immerse yourself in the intricate world of organised crime and gang dynamics, applying for registered gang might be your next step.

If accepted, a new world of gang politics is unveiled, allowing yourself to engage in hostility with rival Gangs, or simply striving to rise to the top.
