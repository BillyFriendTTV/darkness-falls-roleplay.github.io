# Rule Breaches & Player Complaints

FDG has [rules](/server-docs/rules/rules-overview) in place to ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all. If you've been the victim of or witnessed a rule breach, you can [report it in-game](#submitting-an-in-game-report-message) or [submit a player complaint](#submitting-a-player-complaint-on-the-support-portal).

## How to Report a Rule Breach

::alert{type="warning"}
If you are **currently in-game** and the alleged rule breach has **just occurred**, you should **send an [in-game report message](#submitting-an-in-game-report-message) first**.
::

You can either:
- Send an in-game report message; or,
- Submit a player complaint on the [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com) by opening a ticket

### Submitting an In-Game Report Message
1. Open chat using the `T` key. 
2. Type `/report (a brief description of the event that occurred)`. See the below example.

Example in-game report messages:
- `/report ive just been killed for no reason`
- `/report person near me using racial slurs`

If online staff are available, they will respond to you. You can have a conversation with them by continuing to use the `/report` command as instructed on-screen.

Depending on the nature of the alleged breach, you may be directed to:
- Join the **Waiting Room** voice channel in the [FDG Community Discord](https://discord.gg/fatduckgaming); or,
- Open a ticket on the [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com)

## Tips for Submitting Player Complaints

The [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com) provides a template to direct players on what information is needed for a valid player complaint. Nonetheless, there are several things to keep in mind which may prevent your complaint from being rejected, saving everyone's time and effort.

### Read the Rules First

::alert{type="info"}
The rules are available on [this site](/server-docs/rules/rules-overview), the [FDG Community Discord](https://discord.gg/fatduckgaming) in `#rules` and in-game using the `F11` key.
::

When you submit a player complaint, you are alleging the reported player(s) broke server rules. When staff process player complaints, they decide whether the reported player(s) act(s) or omission(s) were inconsistent with server rules. Understanding the rules thoroughly will not only help you in accurately identifying potential violations but also ensure that your complaint is relevant and valid.

### Gather Sufficient Evidence

::alert{type="warning"}
**Evidence is key.** If you don't provide any evidence, the complaint will more than likely be **rejected****.
::

When reporting a player, providing solid evidence is paramount. Ensure you have enough proof to support your claims, such as screenshots, videos, or chat logs, clearly displaying the alleged rule-breaking behavior. Remember that the more compelling evidence you can present, the easier it becomes for the staff to assess the situation and make a fair judgment. If you don't provide any evidence, the complaint will be more-than-likely rejected. Though staff members have access to supplementary evidence in the form of server logs, it is **not** their responsibility to provide the necessary evidence for your complaint.

### Submit ASAP
While it's essential to gather sufficient evidence and present a well-structured complaint, it's equally important to submit it promptly. Delays in reporting incidents might lead to loss of crucial evidence or make it harder for the staff to investigate effectively. Act swiftly, but ensure your complaint is comprehensive and thought-out.
