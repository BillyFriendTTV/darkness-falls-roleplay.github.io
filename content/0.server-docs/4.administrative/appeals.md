# Appealing Administrative Decisions

::callout{type="warning"}
#summary
Banned for cheating or hacking? **You will not be unbanned.** Click to learn more.
#content
FDG adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards hacking and cheating. If you were banned for cheating or hacking (see [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules)) you will **not be unbanned**.

Exceptions only occur when evidence submitted proves you did not cheat or hack. 

Remember, the account owner bears full responsibility for the actions carried out through their account, irrespective of the person using it.
::


All account owners *generally* have the right to appeal administrative decisions issued against their account. Administrative decisions include:

- Timeouts
- Warnings
- Temporary & Permanent Bans

You should submit an appeal if you reasonably believe:

- An administrative decision was issued incorrectly; or,
- An administrative decision is overly harsh

## Submitting an Appeal

All appeals must be submitted online via the [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets/create/29). The FDG Forums, where appeals were formerly lodged, reached end-of-life mid 2023.

### Step 1 - Consider Your Eligibility

Although all players have a *general* right to appeal, there are several rules and eligibility requirements to consider. Considering your eligibility **before submitting an appeal** can prevent wasted time.

Appeals submitted for bans issued in response to a breach of [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules) are **automatically denied**. Exceptions only occur when submitted evidence proves the ban was issued in error. [Community Rule C2](/server-docs/rules/community-wide-rules) captures:

::list{type="danger"}
- Cheating 
- Hacking 
::

You should only consider appealing an administrative decision if:

::list{type="success"}
- An administrative decision was issued incorrectly; or,
- An administrative decision is overly harsh
::

### Step 2 - Gather Evidence

Evidence is **required** for most appeals. Prior to drafting an appeal, upload any evidence you intend to submit to a streaming or hosting service like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Streamable](https://streamable.com/), or [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). 

Any video evidence submitted must meet FDG's minimum standards listed below. Submitted footage not complying with these standards **may not be considered** when assessing your appeal.

::list{type="warning"}
 - Must include at least **2 minutes** of RP, if applicable; and,
 - Must include **audio**, if available; and,
 - Must not be **edited**, except for trimming
::

### Step 3 - Submit an Appeal

All appeals are submitted online via [FDG Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets). Submit an appeal by opening a new ticket in the `Administrative Action Appeal` category, accessible via the button below or directly via https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets/create/29.

## Appeals FAQ

### How long will my appeal take?

Every administrative appeal is assessed on a case-by-case basis by Senior Staff and does not have a specified response time. All appeals are subject to a **minimum 48 hour review period.** You should periodically check for updates to your appeal by [viewing your ticket](https://support.fatduckgaming.com).

### My appeal was denied, can I appeal again?
Maybe. Administrative appeal decisions are generally **final**. You should not appeal again unless instructed to again at a later date. Staff may provide a re-appeal period in the response to your original appeal. Continually submitting appeals unnecessarily may result in your account being banned from accessing FDG Support Services, meaning you'll never be able to submit an appeal again.
