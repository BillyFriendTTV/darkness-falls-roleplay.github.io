# Open vs Whitelisted Jobs

By **Isaiah** & **basedgod**

## About
Jobs on FDG can be broadly placed into two categories: **Open** and **Whitelisted**. 

**Whitelisted** job employees can often have a significant impact on other players and therefore require a vetting process to prevent untrustworthy individuals from abusing their power. **Open** jobs are more accessible to newer players and often consist of easy tasks that provide small amounts of money.

## Whitelisted Jobs

Whitelisted jobs can primarily be categorised into two administrative areas, Department of Justice (DoJ)  and Department of Commerce (DoC) overseen by a Community Leader. These jobs often have a significant number of employees and extensive developmental support. There is also usually incentive to remain employed in a whitelisted job in order to advance through the organisation to achieve higher ranks!

A list of whitelisted jobs can be found below (This list is not exhaustive):

### DoJ Jobs
- San Andreas Police Force
- San Andreas Emergency Services
- Judicial System - Lawyer/Paralegal

### DoC Jobs
- Mechanics (Flywheels, Los Santos Customs, Bennyâ€™s Motorworks and Hayes)

Open jobs are fast and simple ways to make money. They also allow newer players to explore the server as they are sent around to complete a variety of tasks. These jobs are not administered by other players and do not require any application. They can be started at a variety of different locations and can be stopped at any time. 

A list of Non-whitelisted jobs can be found below (This list is not exhaustive):

- GO-Postal Delivery
- San Andreas Council Missions
- Diving
- Hunting/Fishing
