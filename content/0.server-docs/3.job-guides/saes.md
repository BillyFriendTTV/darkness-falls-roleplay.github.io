## About

Paramedics, firefighters, and doctors are fundamental to the FDG experience. Members of the San Andreas Emergency Services (SAES) are responsible for keeping the citizens of our city safe and healthy. SAES members can expect to interact with almost every type of player on our server as they drive, fly, and even swim to new locations to treat people in distress.  



## What to expect? 
The routine of a SAES member can vary depending on how busy the city is! At peak time, SAES members will be very busy assisting players who have injured themselves. The SAES has a large fleet of vehicles and several aircraft enabling a variety of different experiences for even the most experienced members.

# Equipment and Capabilities
As you climb the ranks in the SAES you will gain access to more advanced and interesting assets. Cadets will initially focus on how to become knowledgeable and capable paramedics. At the same time, the more advanced Rescue or Intensive Care Paramedics will at times find themselves extinguishing large vehicle fires or performing surgery.

Below are just some of the capabilities that the SAES has at their disposal:


## Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS)

The SAES have access to an advanced fleet of rotary aircraft which they can use to rapidly respond to emergencies in hard-to-reach locations in the County area north of Los Santos. Once you receive the necessary training you can use these helicopters whenever the need arises.



## Fire and Rescue

Vehicle accidents are unfortunately all too common in San Andreas and when these incidents arise they are often accompanied by a fiery explosion. The task of extinguishing these blazes falls to the members of the SAES’ Fire and Rescue officers who use a fleet of Fire Trucks to rapidly respond to emergencies and keep members of the public safe. 



## Intensive Care Paramedics

Intensive Care Paramedics (ICPs) are some of the more skilled, and experienced members of the SAES. They are responsible for conducting more challenging surgeries that require a high standard of medical knowledge. ICPs are usually required to conduct advanced medical procedures for individuals with significant injuries, including headshot wounds and high-speed impacts.
