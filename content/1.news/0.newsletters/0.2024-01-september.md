## Development 

As usual the development team have been working hard to keep the city fresh, unique and ever changing here are just some of the notable changes that were released this month! 

### QOL Changes.

- We now have the ability to see our the health of our vehicles directly from the garage.
-  Groups on the phone you can now invite a group chat saving time from copying and pasting every number. 
- You can now change plates from the FDF application, a very welcome return. Quack FM launching a DMCA free radio station.

- Ability to freeze clothing so items such as helmets, hats and glasses do not fall of during a punch on using the /freezeclothing command
- Ability to use tab to complete commands.

### LSD / Salvia Changes

We’ve made adjustments to the effects of LSD and Salvia, reducing the health restoration from 50% to 25% and decreasing the trip duration to 60 seconds. These changes are designed to improve gameplay balance by making these substances less overpowering while still retaining their unique effects. By halving the health boost, players will need to be more strategic in their usage, rather than relying on them as a quick fix during intense situations.

The shorter trip duration also ensures that players can get back into action faster, maintaining the flow of gameplay without prolonged downtime. This reduction aims to strike a better balance between the benefits of using these items and the potential risks they carry, encouraging more thoughtful decision-making when choosing to use them. Overall, these changes reflect our commitment to refining gameplay mechanics for a fairer and more engaging experience across the board.


### Loading Screens

We’ve introduced a variety of new loading screens to freshen up the experience and give players a more visually dynamic start each time they enter the game. These new loading screens feature a mix of themes, showcasing everything from iconic cityscapes to action-packed scenes that reflect the vibrant life within the city. In addition we have added competition submitted load in screens into the mix.

### Vehicles 

This month, we rolled out over 15 releases and re-releases, reflecting our ongoing commitment to keeping our platform fresh and packed with new features. Among these updates, we are especially excited to announce the long-awaited addition of full wheel support. This enhancement has been highly requested by our user community, and it brings a new level of immersion and control for those who enjoy a more realistic, hands-on experience. We also had the long awaited release of the GT WB.

### Web Service Updates

Snakey has been putting in extra hours to enhance the web service panel, bringing a range of new features that improve user experience and functionality. One of the key issues addressed is the inability to view older tickets that users had previously raised. With these updates, users can now easily access their entire ticket history, making it simpler to track ongoing issues, reference past resolutions, and manage support requests more effectively. Thanks to Snakey's efforts, the panel is now more robust, user-friendly, and efficient for handling all support-related activities

### Project FPS

The stream team has been hard at work optimizing various assets to significantly improve overall performance throughout the city. By meticulously refining textures, models, and other resource-intensive elements. This will be an on-going project.

### Mapping Update

The New Pacific Bank has been introduced to the city, bringing back its beloved classic interior, now enhanced with a few new updates to the building’s design. This addition not only revives a familiar location but also offers a fresh take on its layout and features, making it more engaging for players. Alongside this new addition, we’ve made a series of adjustments to the map to further optimize performance and address various bugs present in the vanilla version

## Community Events  

### Staff Applications 

Over the past 2 months, we released two waves of new staff applications to the community, welcoming a fresh group of dedicated members to the team. These new additions are here to enhance our support system, providing assistance with issues, responding to reports, and managing tickets more efficiently. With their help, we aim to ensure that all players receive timely and reliable support, contributing to a smoother and more enjoyable experience across the board. As our community grows, so does our commitment to maintaining a responsive and effective support team. Our new staff members have undergone training to handle a variety of player concerns, from troubleshooting technical issues to addressing gameplay-related questions. They’re here to help you navigate any challenges you encounter and make sure your voice is heard. We encourage everyone to keep an eye out for future staff application openings, as we’re always on the lookout for passionate individuals who want to contribute to our community. Additionally, please join us in welcoming our new team members as they step into their roles. Let’s make them feel supported as they work diligently to keep our community thriving and ensure that everyone has a positive experience. 

### Car Auctions 

During this period, we hosted another highly anticipated Car Auction, offering the community a unique opportunity to bid on a wide selection of rare, permanent-sized vehicles. From sleek sports cars and luxury rides to more unconventional items like vans loaded with illicit goods, there was something for everyone—whether you were looking to score the car of your dreams or invest in a vehicle with a bit more... utility.

This auction was particularly exciting, as it included two of the coveted WB-GT models, which attracted fierce bidding and brought in impressive amounts of money. These exclusive vehicles are not only a status symbol but also a testament to the rarity and value within our community.
