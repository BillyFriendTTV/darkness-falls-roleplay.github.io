# Incident Report: The Infinite Loop Fiasco  

## Summary  
At precisely 2:22 PM, Luke, FDG's valiant head scripter, began deploying the beta version of the dispatch script. Spirits were high, and everything seemed to be on track for a smooth rollout. But, as fate would have it, the deployment gods had other plans.  

## What Went Wrong  
In the name of server optimization and probably a touch of overconfidence, a fateful decision was made: the on-call lead developer, **kn0pee**, together with **Luke** and a trusted advisory council of **Martibo** and **Snakey**, agreed to tweak the update intervals.  

The goal? Smoother operations and fewer server hiccups.  
The reality? A disaster so spectacular it could have been a plotline in a tech sitcom.  

The plan was simple—until a rogue series of unfortunate script line deletions crept in. These deletions included *the* critical `wait` line inside a `while true` loop. What should have been an elegant, measured flow of updates became an unstoppable, ravenous code beast.  

## The Fallout  
- The server locked itself in an existential crisis, spinning in an infinite loop faster than a hamster on a caffeine overdose.  
- Players across the FDG community were collectively booted into the digital void as the server sighed its last functional breath.  
- Chaos ensued. Voices echoed in the distance:  
  - “What just happened?”  
  - “Luke, you broke it again!”  

## Resolution  
Recognizing the code catastrophe, the team sprang into action. With the speed of a thousand hotfixes, the server was restarted. Miraculously, all services returned to normal, and the players were reunited with their beloved FDG world.  

## Lessons Learned  
1. **Infinite Loops = Infinite Pain**: Always include a `wait` statement in loops. It’s not just best practice—it’s the difference between functioning servers and mass chaos.  
2. **Peer Review, Please**: Advisory groups are great, but maybe double-check each other’s work next time?  
3. **Testing is Not Optional**: Test in a controlled environment, not live servers. This isn’t a video game speedrun.  
4. **Luke’s Law**: If it *can* break, Luke will find a way to break it. (*Luke, we still love you, though.*)  

## Conclusion  
Despite the temporary setback, FDG’s resilience shone through. Let this serve as a humorous yet cautionary tale for all developers: check your loops, test your scripts, and never underestimate the power of a single missing line of code.  

Here’s to fewer loops, smoother deployments, and more epic stories for future incident reports.
