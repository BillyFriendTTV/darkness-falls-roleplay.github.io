# The Dangers of Non-HTTPS Links

If you’ve just received a warning about a link not being HTTPS, you might be wondering what that means for your online safety. Here’s a quick rundown of why HTTPS is important and the risks associated with non-HTTPS links.

## What is HTTPS?

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It’s a secure version of HTTP, the protocol used to transfer data between your browser and a website. HTTPS uses encryption to protect the data you send and receive from being intercepted by third parties.

## Why HTTPS Matters

::list{type="primary"}
- **Data Protection:** HTTPS encrypts your data, making it much harder for hackers to steal your personal information, such as login details or credit card numbers.
- **Website Integrity:** HTTPS ensures that the website you’re visiting is the one it claims to be. Without it, there’s a higher risk of being redirected to a fake site designed to steal your information.
- **Trustworthiness:** Modern browsers flag non-HTTPS sites as "Not Secure," which can make visitors wary. Using HTTPS helps build trust with your users.

## Risks of Non-HTTPS Links

::list{type="danger"}
- **Data Theft:** On a non-HTTPS site, your data is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals. This can lead to identity theft or financial fraud.
- **Malware:** Non-HTTPS sites are more likely to be compromised and used to distribute malware, which can infect your device and harm your data.
- **Phishing:** Without HTTPS, it’s easier for malicious actors to create fake versions of legitimate websites, tricking you into entering sensitive information.

## What Should You Do?

If you see a warning about a non-HTTPS link, it’s best to avoid proceeding. The warning is there to protect you from potential risks. Always look for the padlock symbol in the address bar and ensure the URL starts with "https://" before entering any personal information.

Staying safe online means being cautious and informed. If you’re ever unsure, it’s better to err on the side of caution and not visit the site.
